# Descisions & Reasons Log

## AWS

- Familiar with it, cheap, and it can do a lot.

## Lambda

- Don't need the power computational and configurational
- State is a cause of pain... want to reduce what I manage in terms of state on all levels. Keep it functional & stateless!

## DynamoDB

- Scalable
- Can have what are essentially slaves, so can test (automatically)

## Swagger + APIGateway

- Handles the boilerplate

## Terraform

- Configuration as code. Want everything to do with the site in the codebase. There is no distinction between Dev and Ops!
